## ✨ Design Philosophy

The Şahî (Shahi) Font is built on four core principles:

### 1. Cultural and Spiritual Inclusivity
The designs intentionally avoid sectarian or religious symbolism, presenting chess imagery in a universal, welcoming form. This supports multilingual, multicultural, and multi-faith educational environments and reflects the global heritage shared by chess players in Europe, Asia, Africa, and beyond.

### 2. Historical Authenticity
The artwork draws inspiration from a broad spectrum of historic chess traditions, including:
- early shatranj and Middle Eastern – Central Asian designs,
- medieval and Renaissance European chess sets,
- archaeological and museum-documented piece styles from multiple regions.

While historically grounded, each icon is refined for clarity, readability, and consistency in modern digital usage. For example, the rook piece has been historically called 4 different names: chariot, tower, cannon, boat. The design of the Şahî (Shahi) rook physical piece and its corresponding icon have elements of the wheel from the chariot, bricks from the tower, barrel of a cannon, and the anchor of a boat. The vizier piece has a military helmet as the commander of the army, which can also be viewed as the tip of a pen of a statesman. The shah piece has the dome under the which the ruler lives and its wise headwrap, which looks like a rose with petals, symbolizing life and fragility of the shah (king) piece. The elephant piece is inspired by the Charlemagne-Abbas elephant.

### 3. Modern Utility
The vector-based SVG format and clean outlines ensure compatibility with:
- online chess platforms and real-time game interfaces,
- websites and front-end frameworks,
- mobile and desktop applications,
- game engines and graphical toolkits,
- software that uses scalable icon systems.

The font is optimized for on-screen display, retaining shape clarity at any resolution.

### 4. Educational Purpose
The Şahî Font is used across the Shatranj.ai curriculum and STEAM programs that connect chess logic with mathematics, coding, and artificial intelligence. It supports teachers, researchers, and curriculum designers who require culturally neutral and historically informed visual material.

## 🔤 Culturally Unifying Naming & Terminology

The Şahî Font was designed for both modern chess and historic chess, which was played across the Middle East, Mediterranean, Africa, and Europe. The Şahî (Shahi) Font reflects historical chess and shatranj heritage and is designed with culturally inclusive, religiously neutral principles. The designer prefers to use one unified terminology for both chess and shatranj, because the rules of the games are very similar and chess evolved from shatranj. For English-language educational use, the creator’s preferred terminology for the chess pieces is: shah, vizier, rook, elephant, horse, and pawn. These correspond respectively to the king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn. 

For example, the chess piece known in English as “bishop” is called “elephant” in the majority of the world’s languages. In old English, it was once called an archer. Likewise, the piece called “queen” in modern English chess is associated with an advisor, vizier, or statesman figure in many linguistic traditions, and is also understood as a military leader in languages such as Polish and Hungarian.

Platforms and educators are welcome to use these preferred terms where appropriate. Other languages may continue using their own established chess vocabularies. This recommendation is provided to support cultural context and educational clarity and is not a mandatory naming requirement.


### Chess / Shatranj Culturally Inclusive English Terminology
Preferred English teaching terms used by the creator:
- **Shah** → King  
- **Vizier** → Queen  
- **Rook** → Rook  
- **Elephant** → Bishop  
- **Horse** → Knight  
- **Pawn** → Pawn
