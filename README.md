## ✨ Design Philosophy

The Şahî (Shahi) Font is built on four core principles:

### 1. Cultural and Spiritual Inclusivity
The designs intentionally avoid sectarian or religious symbolism, presenting chess imagery in a universal, welcoming form. This supports multilingual, multicultural, and multi-faith educational environments and reflects the global heritage shared by chess players in Europe, Asia, Africa, and beyond.

### 2. Historical Authenticity
The artwork draws inspiration from a broad spectrum of historic chess traditions, including:
- early shatranj and Middle Eastern – Central Asian designs,
- medieval and Renaissance European chess sets,
- archaeological and museum-documented piece styles from multiple regions.

While historically grounded, each icon is refined for clarity, readability, and consistency in modern digital usage. For example, the rook piece has been historically called 4 different names: chariot, tower, cannon, boat. The design of the Şahî (Shahi) rook physical piece and its corresponding icon have elements of the wheel from the chariot, bricks from the tower, barrel of a cannon, and the anchor of a boat. The vizier piece has a military helmet as the commander of the army, which can also be viewed as the tip of a pen of a statesman. The shah piece has the dome under the which the ruler lives and its wise headwrap, which looks like a rose with petals, symbolizing life and fragility of the shah (king) piece. The elephant piece is inspired by the Charlemagne-Abbas elephant.

### 3. Modern Utility
The vector-based SVG format and clean outlines ensure compatibility with:
- online chess platforms and real-time game interfaces,
- websites and front-end frameworks,
- mobile and desktop applications,
- game engines and graphical toolkits,
- software that uses scalable icon systems.

The font is optimized for on-screen display, retaining shape clarity at any resolution.

### 4. Educational Purpose
The Şahî Font is used across the Shatranj.ai curriculum and STEAM programs that connect chess logic with mathematics, coding, and artificial intelligence. It supports teachers, researchers, and curriculum designers who require culturally neutral and historically informed visual material.

## 🔤 Culturally Unifying Naming & Terminology

The Şahî was designed for both modern chess and historic chess, which was played across the Middle East, Mediterranean, Africa, and Europe. The Şahî (Shahi) Font reflects modern chess and shatranj heritage and is designed with culturally inclusive, religiously neutral principles. Chess pieces have been called different names across languages and time, which you can read more in the table here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece

As the designer of these icons, you should know that I was exposed to chess terminology in many different languages since a young age, and I learned that chess pieces had sometimes more than a single name in a region or langugage. I was born in Yugoslavia, currently Macedonia, and learned chess from my grandfather who was an educator, translator, and one of the first dictionary writers in the Balkans. So I grew up learning chess terminology in Turkish, Serbo-Croation, and Albanian. For example, in the Balkans they used to call the elephant piece, fil in Turkish, lovac as the hunter in Serbo-Croation, and both fili and oficieri in Albanian. I grew up in Istanbul and started to attend since age 8 the Istanbul Chess Assocation locale in Beyoglu, where many masters played from various backgrounds, chess players from Armenian, Greek, and Jewish communities of Istanbul attended. Their own chess piece terms differed from Turkish chess piece terminology, with some overlap in meaning. At that time, I wasn't so aware of this overlap and difference in terminology, but later in life, I started to apprecite this diversity more. Later, when I attended a German-Turkish highschool in Istanbul, I learned chess from German and English chessbooks. I got my first ELO and got a FM title during European Juniors U20 in Estonia, where they call the elephant chess piece the spear. At Turkish national team, I was coached by World Seniors Chess Champion Evgeny Vasiukov, who knew little English and spoke mostly in Russian. So I was exposed to chess terminology in many languages as I grew up and became Turkish National Champion in 2000.

I should tell a story here, so I understand some of my motivation. Jiray Çakır, the Armenian-Turkish resident, was the president of the Turkish Chess Federation was also a chess teacher at the Galatasaray French Lycee in Beyoglu. He was influential in inviting Kasparov to Istanbul to play a simul against Turkish young players in 1997. I was one of the players in this simul and was able to hold a draw against Kasparov. Many years after in 2024, I met Kasparov in Boston and gifted him the elephant piece of the Şahi chess set. Now, Kasparov was a very multicultural person himself. As you can see in his life story, he had Armenian mother and a Jewish father and was born in Azerbaijan. He grew up in Moscow and considers him culturally Russian. Now altough in Armenian, Hebrew, Azerbaijani and Russian, the elephant piece is being called an elephant, Kasparov probably never played with an elephant chess piece, but rather only the bishop design with a mitre from the Staunton set. So I gifted him the Şahî physical set and held the elephant piece in my hand in our photo.  It felt that this piece could have been designed like an elephant with the new production techniques of the 20th century and be more consistent with the language we use for chess terms in most of the world.

So you are welcome and encouraged to use multilingual terminology in your teachings of chess with the Şahî icons. I think chess offers a great way to pick language fluency, especially for young children.

Sometimes, I prefer to use one unified terminology for both chess and shatranj, because the rules of the games are very similar and chess evolved from shatranj, which evolved from chaturanga. For English-language educational use, my preferred terminology for the chess pieces is: shah, vizier, rook, elephant, horse, and pawn. These correspond respectively to the king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn. 

I should add a few details here about the design here. The chess piece known in English as “bishop” is called “elephant” in the majority of the world’s languages, including Spanish, Russian, Armenian, Chinese, and Turkish. In old English, it was once called an archer. Likewise, the piece called “queen” in modern English chess is associated with an advisor, vizier, or statesman figure in many linguistic traditions including Belarussian, and is also understood as a military leader in languages such as Polish and Hungarian. The pawns are inspired by the Regence Cafe chess set, while the top of the queen piece is inspired by Austrian cafe house chess sets and the Lasker-Schlechter 1911 World Championship set. The rook is inspired by South Slavic designs where this piece is called "top", meaning cannon.

Platforms and educators are welcome and encouraged to use multilingual terminology where appropriate. This recommendation is provided to support cultural context and educational clarity and is not a mandatory naming requirement.
