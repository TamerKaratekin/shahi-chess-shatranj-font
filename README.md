# Şahî Chess & Shatranj Font  
A culturally inclusive, educational, and cross-platform SVG icon font for chess, shatranj, and historic variants.

The **Şahî (Shahi) Font** is a vector-based chess & shatranj piece set designed by **Tamer Karatekin** (DeepSeaChess LLC).  
It combines modern clarity with historical authenticity and cultural neutrality, making it suitable for:

- educational materials  
- school programs and STEAM curricula  
- chess & shatranj software  
- websites and game engines  
- Lichess-compatible variants  
- academic, cultural, and historical presentations  

This repository contains the original, unmodified SVG and font files in **versioned folders** (`v1/` and `v2/`).

## ✨ Design Philosophy

The Şahî Font is built on four pillars:

### 1. Cultural Inclusivity  
The icons avoid sectarian or religious symbolism and emphasize universal design.  
This aligns with the goal of **making chess welcoming for all cultures**, especially in multilingual and multi-faith classrooms.

### 2. Historical Authenticity  
The designs draw from the **Golden Age of Islamic Science**, the **Silk Road**, and early **shatranj** traditions while remaining clear and usable in modern digital interfaces.

### 3. Modern Utility  
Clean SVG paths and font files ensure compatibility with:

- web front-end frameworks  
- mobile and desktop apps  
- game engines  
- font-face embedding  
- icon workflows  

### 4. Educational Purpose  
The font is used across the **Shatranj.ai** curriculum, primary school STEAM learning, and teacher-training programs.
