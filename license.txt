12. Cultural Terminology (Non-Binding Recommendation)
The Şahî (Shahi) Font reflects historical chess and shatranj heritage and is designed with culturally inclusive, religiously neutral principles. For English-language educational use, the creator’s preferred terminology for the chess pieces is: shah, vizier, rook, elephant, horse, and pawn. These correspond respectively to the king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn. 

For example, the chess piece known in English as “bishop” is called “elephant” in the majority of the world’s languages. In old English, it was once called an archer. Likewise, the piece called “queen” in modern English chess is associated with an advisor, vizier, or statesman figure in many linguistic traditions, and is also understood as a military leader in languages such as Polish and Hungarian.

Platforms and educators are welcome to use these preferred terms where appropriate. Other languages may continue using their own established chess vocabularies. This recommendation is provided to support cultural context and educational clarity and is not a mandatory naming requirement.


12. No Warranty  
The Font is provided “as-is,” without warranty of any kind. The copyright holder is not liable for any damages or issues arising from its use.
